##Resources
* I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment asside from the below mentioned plugins.

###Plugins
* [http://stickyjs.com/](http://stickyjs.com/)
  * This plugin makes any element on a page remain visible at all times. I used this plugin to stick the header to the top of the page upon scroll. 
* [http://wayou.github.io/SlipHover/#quick-start](http://wayou.github.io/SlipHover/#quick-start)
  * This plugin applies a hover effect over an image, sliding over based on the direction of the mouse movement. I used this plugin on the picture of myself, using the tag of the image in the HTML to populate the caption. 

###Written Code
* The custom written code for this project selects an element and inserts a paragraph with text after. This code is utilized 5 times, one for each entry in the 'Experience' and 'Education' sections, adding the date each occoured. 

##Coments
* The sticky header seems to take a moment to catch up when the browser is resized, specifically the background placed on this element to provide better ease of reading for the viewer. I can not figure out why this is, but it does work fully.
